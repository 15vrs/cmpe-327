## Test Plan

points to cover:
- How test cases of different levels (frontend, backend units, integration) are organized.
- The order ot the test cases (which level first which level second).
- Techniques and tools used for testing.
- Environments (all the local environment and the cloud environment) for the testing.
- Responsibility (who is responsible for which test case, and in case of failure, who should you contact)
- Budget Management (you have limited CI action minutes, how to monitor, keep track and minimize unncessary cost)
